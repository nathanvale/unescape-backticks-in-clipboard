# Unescape Backticks in Clipboard

Effortlessly remove escape characters from backticks in your clipboard content. This extension scans your clipboard for any escaped backticks (‚Å†\``) and replaces them with actual backticks (``  ``), ensuring your text is clean and ready for use in code, documentation, or any other context where unescaped backticks are needed.
